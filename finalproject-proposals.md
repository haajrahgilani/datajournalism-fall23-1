# Final project options

To help you, the students, get as most out of the final project as possible, we have some options. To ensure that deadlines and periodic check-ins are consistent (and for my sanity), we'll decide what the class will do via a vote. 

## 1. Traditional story

Working solo or in pairs, students will pitch, report and visualize a data-driven story between 1,000 and 2,000 words based substantially on a dataset, with at least two data visualizations, due at the second to last class.

The story should answer an interesting question using data. The data component of the story must be substantial, and you need to dig into the dataset. If you just read toplines off a website without actually finding and downloading or creating a dataset, that is insufficient.

**Pros:**

* Will have a portfolio piece for your clips
* Will get experience doing all steps of a data-driven story

**Cons:**

* Can be challenging to complete in a 10-week class


## 2. Story memo

Working solo or in pairs, students will pitch and pre-report a data-driven story. The final project will be a detailed reporting memo describing the steps used to analyze the data, findings from the data, etc., as well as plans for how you would report and structure this story if given more time. You should be able to include possible data visualizations in this memo.

Same criteria as above for what is considered a "data-driven" story.

**Pros:**

* Will allow us to focus more time on reporting and data work, giving you a deeper level of experience in these areas
* Will allow you to finish the story indepently or as part of your enterprise class next quarter

**Cons:**

* Will not have a portfolio piece
* Will not practice _writing_ about data
